Welcome to Emilia's documentation!
==================================

This is the Emilia **django starter** boilerplate project.

The documentation is currently under development along with the project, and
it's not ready for use as of yet. Some of the planned features:

- **different virtual environments** for testing, development, and production
- Project structure
- **HTML5 Bootstrap Boilerplate**
- Functional and Unit tests
- Robots and Humans.txt files preconfigured
- User Registration
- Sphinx Documentation
- **OAuth2 Authentication**

To get started using this boilerplate, check out :doc:`requirements` and after
that head over to :doc:`quick_start`.
